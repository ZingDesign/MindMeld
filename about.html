                <h4>Meet Brenda</h4>

                <p>Brenda Ratcliff is a leadership coach and trainer using NLP techniques based on understanding how
                    successful communicators get the results they want, and applying these same skills to situations that require change.  She gets a real charge from helping her clients move from static mindsets which hold them back to living a life of purpose and fulfillment.</p>

                <p>Over her career, Brenda has held significant roles including as the Lead HR Advisor Organisational Development at the Ministry of Social Development. She has won two IPANZ awards which she says felt like winning the public service equivalent of an OSCAR, for her Talent Management Programme and her leadership simulation on political nous, where participants got to be the Chief Executive with all of its guts and glory and pitfalls.  This ‘Chief for a Day’ programme also went on to win the HRINZ public service award.</p>

                <p>Brenda was also a Winston Churchill Fellow, where she journeyed to England and Ireland to focus on the development of outcome indicators for children’s services.  She also held role of the Director Office for the Community and Voluntary Sector, a pivotal interface between government and the community and voluntary sector which required working directly to government ministers and chief executives.  Brenda counts as a career highlight winning a Leadership Development Centre Fellowship to Stanford University to study Leadership and the Effective Use of Power, and returning to coach other senior executives to successfully secure their own dream study adventures.</p>

                <h4>The meaning behind the logo</h4>

                <p>While traveling in Ireland over the Millennium, in a tiny rain-soaked village, at the back of the green beyond, Brenda learned about these stone carvings of eighth century monks, and did a quick free hand drawing. She chose this motif as her logo because of the companionship and calm demeanor expressed in the carvings, which to her, represent the essence of the journey travelled by clients in their quest to be the best they can be.</p>
