                <h2>Mindmeld Coaching’s two mantras</h2>

                <div class="first">
                    <h4>1. Think Right Act Right</h4>
                    <p>Our minds are like a garden - helpful thoughts are like flowers, and unhelpful thoughts are like weeds which can run rampant if we keep our thought processes unchecked. In order to have our lives blossom and grow we have to weed the garden regularly.  When you think thoughts that are helpful to you, then you will act accordingly.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h4>2. We GROW our Clients, we don’t harvest them</h4>
                    <p>The GROW model is a great coaching tool for working with individual clients and groups. GROW stands for each of the four coaching phases of identifying your Goal, exploring your current Reality, brainstorming Options, and creating an action plan for your Way Forward.  In this way, clients get to the end of a coaching session knowing how to create positive and profound changes, and so they ‘flower’ after just one session. While we do enjoy long lasting relationship with clients, we help them make changes and become independent to get on with their lives.</p>

                    <p>Brenda’s approach is very unique. She looks at the whole person and understands how to personalise each coaching session for each client. She has a technique for working out what learning style they are most receptive to and then runs the session like that and gets great results. I think Brenda is amazing and have recommended her to so many people.</p>
